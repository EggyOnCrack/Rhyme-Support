# Rhyme-Support

## Rhyme

<br> Rhyme is a multi guild supported, multi-purpose bot that allows features that most bots don't allow! Rhyme was just a random discovered name created by Egghead, the Founder of Rhyme. Rhyme first started in between November and from then, it has served communities the best they could imagine! Rhyme offers 24/7 Support and fast response, but sadly fast response through Direct Messages will have a delayed response... <br>
